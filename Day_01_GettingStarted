# 1. Set Up Your Environment
## 1.1. Install Homebrew (Optional but Recommended)

Homebrew is a package manager that makes it easy to install and manage many development tools on macOS. If you already have it, skip this step.
Open the Terminal app and run:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

## 1.2. Install Python 3

brew install python

Confirm that Python is installed:

python3 --version
